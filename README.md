# ISYS5002_Assignment_One
A repository for the assignment for ISYS5002 
The file named Sandbox Practice is where all of the building and trialing occurred. Please access these files and version history to see how the program was built.
The file titled 'final' is the result of all the building thus the program itself; the version to be marked
I was not sure as to where to write my thinking/ notes in the program and therefore they are located at the top of the notebook
The code also contains comments as the purpose of each function.
